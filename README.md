Multi Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for Zero-day attack Detection

Critical industries such as manufacturing, power generation, and intelligent transportation are increasingly using IIoT systems, making these industries more susceptible to cyberattacks. To counter these cyberattacks, policymakers have made strong guidelines, and various security provisions like secure authentication and encryption mechanisms as effective countermeasures for these systems. The exponential rise in cyberattacks has proven that all these measures are not sufficient to protect IIoT systems and have certain limitations. Considering theprogress in Artificial Intelligence, it is widely acknowledged that Machine learning (ML) based intrusion detection systems (IDS) hold significant potential for identifying these cyberattacks. Numerous ML-based IDS have been proposed,which are capable of detecting known attacks but fail to recognize unknown or zero-day attacks; hence, this issue is one of the most important things to worry about for cyber professionals. One of the most prominent concerns in the cyber
industry is how threat intelligence could be used to provide protection against zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats (APTs) in IIoT environments. A hybrid multi stage Intrusion Detection System (HMS-IDS) has been proposed which is driven by supervised and unsupervised approach to identify both known 1 and zero-day cyberattacks in IIoT environments. Through meticulous evaluation on the esteemed CIC-ToN-IoT dataset, the proposed IDS model attains staggering levels of accuracy, reaching an impressive 99.49% in detecting known attacks and an exceptional 98.936% in identifying unknown attacks. These compelling findings unequivocally substantiate the systemâ€™s efficacy in real-time detection of malicious cyber incursions targeting IIoT devices, thereby underscoring its tremendous potential for wide-scale implementation and practical deployment.
