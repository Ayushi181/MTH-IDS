# MTH-IDS
Multi Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for Zero-day attack Detection

Description:
The Hybrid Multi-Stage Intrusion Detection System (HMS-IDS) is an advanced cybersecurity solution designed to protect Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments in critical industries, including manufacturing, power generation, and intelligent transportation. This project aims to address the growing threat landscape posed by cyberattacks, particularly zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats (APTs).

Key Features:
- Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques
- Identifies known and unknown cyberattacks in real-time
- Enhances the security of IIoT devices and critical infrastructure
- Achieves impressive accuracy rates: 99.49% for known attacks and 98.936% for zero-day attacks
- Highly effective in wide-scale implementation and practical deployment

Why HMS-IDS?
With the exponential rise in cyberattacks targeting IIoT systems, traditional security measures are no longer sufficient. HMS-IDS represents a crucial step forward in safeguarding critical industries by providing robust threat detection capabilities.
